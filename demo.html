      <h2> â–¶ How to Play?</h2>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Requirements:</strong><br/>
        You must have a webcam and a bright-colored spherical object (like a tennis ball) with a light-colored background (with constant lighting)
        for the best contrast. There should be no obstructions within a <strong>3 feet</strong> radius (other than a computer) around you to avoid collisions with the surrounding.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Camera Setup:</strong><br/>
        Make sure your webcam is connected and functioning properly. Position yourself about <strong>2.5 feet</strong> from the webcam such that your hand holding the bright-colored spherical
        object is clearly visible.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Calibration Phase:</strong><br/>
        Click the <em>"Play Game"</em> button to begin. You will be prompted with the screen with instructions on how to calibrate the bright-colored spherical object for detection.
        This calibration helps in detecting the object accurately during the gameplay.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Starting the Game:</strong><br/>
        Once calibration is done, click the <em>"Start Game"</em> button to begin the game window. The game will track the calibrated object in your hand and
        display it on the screen as a <em>"Red Ball"</em>.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Controlling the Red Ball:</strong><br/>
        To move the <em>"Red Ball"</em> on the game window, move the calibrated object in your hand in front of the webcam, as parallel to the screen as possible for the best results.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Gameplay Objective:</strong><br/>
        You will see a <em>"Blue Balls"</em> and <em>"Black Balls"</em> on the screen. Colliding the <em>"Red Ball"</em> with the <em>"Blue Ball"</em> will increase your score and
        colliding the <em>"Red Ball"</em> with the <em>"Black Balls"</em> will decrease your score. The objective of the game is to maximize your score by colliding the <em>"Red Ball"</em>
        with the <em>"Blue Ball"</em> as quickly as possible while avoiding collisions with the <em>"Black Balls"</em>.
        The game will start a timer as soon as you click the <em>"Start Game"</em> button.
      </li>

      <li><strong>End of the Game:</strong><br/>
        The game ends after the timer ends and your final score will be displayed on the screen.
      </li>
